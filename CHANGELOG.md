# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented here. Format loosely
follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/); this
project doesn't publish to a registry, so versions are tracked via git tags
(`vX.Y.Z`) rather than npm releases. Versions before 0.3.0 predate this file.

## [0.4.0] - 2026-07-23

### Added

- **rdio-scanner call-upload support**, tracking the native support added in
  the [`rdio_api`](https://github.com/jschmall/RTLSDR-Airband/tree/rdio_api)
  fork branch. A `file` output can now carry a nested `rdio_scanner` block
  (`server`, `port`, `use_tls`, `api_key`, `system_id`, `system_label`,
  `talkgroup_id`, `talkgroup_label`, `talkgroup_tag`, `talkgroup_group`,
  `source_id`, `delete_after_upload`, `timeout_ms`, `max_retries`) that
  uploads each completed transmission to a
  [rdio-scanner](https://github.com/chuot/rdio-scanner) instance's
  call-upload API, in place of the old `post_write_script` + external CSV
  workaround. Covered end to end: parser round-trip (`backend/parser`), HTTP
  body shape validation (`backend/api`), a new semantic check enforcing that
  `rdio_scanner` requires `split_on_transmission` on the same output
  (matching RTLSDR-Airband's own startup validation, `backend/validate`),
  and a collapsible editor section on file outputs with tooltips for every
  field (`frontend`). Only takes effect against an RTLSDR-Airband binary
  built with `-DRDIO_SCANNER=ON` from that fork branch — the panel change
  alone has no effect on existing configs that don't set `rdio_scanner`.

## [0.3.1] - 2026-07-22

### Added

- **Hover tooltips on every config field.** The device, channel/scan-channel,
  output, mixer, and global settings editors now show a plain-language
  explanation on hover (`title` attribute + dotted-underline hint, matching
  the existing Stats page convention), sourced from a new
  `config-descriptions.ts`. Field labels are unchanged — tooltips add depth
  without cluttering the visible label text.
- **Device fields now adapt to device type and channel mode.** `Serial`/
  `Index` are hidden for SoapySDR devices (which are identified by
  `device_string` instead); `Center frequency` is hidden in scan mode
  (the dongle retunes per frequency, so it's unused). Switching a device's
  `type` or `mode` now strips fields that no longer apply (e.g. `buffers`,
  `device_string`, `centerfreq`) instead of leaving stale values sitting in
  the saved config.

### Fixed

- MiriSDR's `correction` field was labeled "ppm" like rtlsdr/soapysdr, but
  RTLSDR-Airband documents it in Hz for that device type. The label (and
  its tooltip) now switch units based on the selected device type.

## [0.3.0] - 2026-07-22

### Added

- **Scan-mode support.** Devices can now be configured with `mode = "scan"`
  and a single channel using `freqs` instead of `freq`. Per-frequency
  fields (`ampfactor`, `ctcss`, `notch`, `notch_q`, `bandwidth`,
  `squelch_threshold`, `squelch_snr_threshold`) accept either one value
  (applied to every scanned frequency) or a comma-separated list with one
  entry per frequency, matching RTLSDR-Airband's own config grammar —
  including the `0`/`-1.0` sentinel values scan mode uses to mean
  "auto-squelch" / "skip this frequency" / "keep the default". `labels`
  and `modulations` lists are also supported.
- **`squelch_threshold`**, alongside the existing `squelch_snr_threshold`,
  on both multichannel and scan-mode channels.
- **Top-level `mixers` block.** Channel outputs of type `mixer` can now
  route into an actual mixer definition (`name`, `disable`, `highpass`,
  `lowpass`, `outputs`) instead of a name with nothing behind it.
- New channel fields: `label`, `notch_q`, `highpass`, `lowpass`, `tau`,
  `disable`.
- New device fields: `mode`, `tau`, `disable`, and type-specific fields —
  `buffers` (rtlsdr), `num_buffers` (mirisdr), `device_string`/`channel`/
  `antenna` (soapysdr). The device type picker in the UI is now a dropdown
  (rtlsdr / mirisdr / soapysdr) instead of free text, and `gain` accepts
  either a number or a SoapySDR `component=value` string (omit entirely to
  enable AGC).
- New global fields: `pidfile`, `log_scan_activity`, `shout_metadata_delay`,
  `tau`.
- New semantic validation checks: scan-mode structural rules (exactly one
  channel per scan-mode device, per-frequency list lengths), device
  field requirements by type/mode (`gain`, `centerfreq`, `device_string`),
  mixer name references, and the `disable` cascade (at least one active
  device/channel/output, per RTLSDR-Airband's own startup constraints).

### Changed

- `Channel` is now a `MultichannelChannel | ScanChannel` union throughout
  the parser, validator, API, and frontend.
